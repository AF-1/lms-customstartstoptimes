Custom Start Stop Times
====

With **Custom Start Stop Times**[^1] you can start and stop tracks at a specific playback time or skip a specific part of the song (e.g. silence) by simply adding custom start, stop or skip times to a track's *comments tag*. With the help of this plugin, the song will start[^2] or end, i.e. skip to the next one, when you want it to, or skip[^2] an unwanted part. No more annoying song intros or minutes of silence.

## Requirements

- LMS version >= 7.**9**
- LMS database = **SQLite**
<br><br><br>


## Comment tag patterns

For this plugin to work, you need to add your custom start, stop or skip times to the **comment tag** of the tracks that you wish to start and stop at custom times or skip a specific part of. For a larger number of songs it probably makes sense to use a script (see macOS Music app example below).<br><br>
Please use the simple **patterns** listed below. They are **case-sensitive** (use upper case) but it doesn't matter whether your time value has a **comma**, a decimal **point** or neither.<br>

### Start time
- The pattern is: `STARTTIME:{time}STARTEND` where {time} is your start time
- Example: `STARTTIME:5,3462STARTEND` will make your song start at 5.3462 seconds.

### Stop time
- The pattern is: `STOPTIME:{time}STOPEND` where {time} is your stop time, i.e. when LMS skips to the next song.
- Example: `STOPTIME:248,32STOPEND` will make LMS skip to the next song after 248.32 seconds.
<br><br>

### Skip part of the song
You will have to set a skip **start** point **and** a time to which the plugin should jump (skip **stop** point). You need to set both. And you cannot skip multiple parts, just one.
- The skip **start** point pattern is: `SKIPSTART:{time}SKIPSTARTXXX` where {time} is the time when LMS should skip to the skip stop point.

- The skip **stop** point pattern is: `SKIPSTOP:{time}SKIPSTOPXXX` where {time} is the time to which LMS should skip from the skip start point.

- Example: `SKIPSTART:156SKIPSTARTXXX SKIPSTOP:337,2SKIPSTOPXXX` will make LMS jump to the playback position 337.2 seconds in the song after 156 seconds.
<br>

üí° If you do a **manual jump** inside the currently playing song **beyond the skip *start* point**, **skipping is disabled** for the currently playing song.
<br><br><br>


## Installation

 **Custom Start Stop Times** is available from the LMS plugin library: **LMS > Settings > Manage Plugins**.<br>

If you want to test a new patch that hasn't made it into a release version yet, you'll have to [install the plugin manually](https://github.com/AF-1/sobras/wiki/Manual-installation-of-LMS-plugins).
<br><br><br>


## Music app (macOS)
If you use the **Music** app on **macOS**, take a look at the simple **Applescript** included in this repository:<br>
- it can gather songs for which you have set **start** or **stop** times in the Music app in a playlist and
- write those start and stop times to the comment tag of those tracks.

Works for me but use at your own risk :-)<br>
If you want to run the script on a large number of tracks, consider *exporting* the script as an *app*.[^3]
<br><br><br>

[^3]: If you want the Music app to list your apps and Applescripts in the Scripts menu, you have to place them in `~/Library/Music/Scripts`.
